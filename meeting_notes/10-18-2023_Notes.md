- **Working group additional items** (example: AGS organization discussion from the Outreach WG)
- **Other items from the community germane to the cc** (e.g. relevant EBP updates, new funding opportunities, meetings/conferences)

The EBP group met on October 6th. Monica is now substituting for Kevin as the i5k rep.

- The meeting was essentially a progress report on EBP for the past year - genomes sequenced per taxonomic grouping; funding increases; publications in high profile journals; genome notes.
- Reminder for this group that i5k metrics are reported to EBP (even though i5k is not the best fit for this group).
- Nicole had a report on EBP communications metrics - if we have good items to share that are worth re-sharing with the EBP on social media, we can send them to Nicole (perhaps when we are ready to announce i5k 2.0?). Rob mentioned that training might be a good thing for EBP to repost, as well. She's done 'fun fact fridays' and 'in the field with EBP' - I imagine she'd be open to contributions from i5k if we have anything. Reminder about article about the EBP that came out in the New Yorker in August.

- EBP scientific committees. Committees are wrapping up phase 1
- sample collection and processing - finishing up V1.0 guidelines; are planning guidance on protocols.io
- sequencing and assembly - finishing up recommendations document, updating standards document
- annotation - finalizing annotation standards including metadata, supporting evidence
- analysis - alignment is a priority, in particular aligning thousands + genomes
- IT and informatics - data service portal design; keeping IT and informatics standards docs updated every six months
- ELSI - finished giving advice on governance document; finalized EBP position on digital sequence information; finishing policy statement on intellectual property; working on a policy statement on data sharing; provide advice to US individuals on US government sanctions on BGI; increased committee composition (geographically). Discussion of species of dual use research concern is on the to-do list.
- EBP JEDI committee: organized many workshops and presentations in 2023. Sessions at PAG2024 in the works; white paper in the works; recruiting new members.
- Nominations committee - ensuring geographic diversity in committees; formed governance committee.
- Governance committee - just started, chaired by Rob. Purpose is to codify how processes should happen in EBP; improve current governance document based on feedback
- Secretariat - EBP secretariat at UC Davis will be dissolved November 2023. Bids for a new secretariat will open in October, due October 31st. 3-year arrangement within new host institution. Office will entail Executive Director; Project coordinator; Consumer coordinator; Outreach coordinator.
- Plans for 2023-2024: Selection of secretariat; Selection of regional nodes; Frontiers publication phase II; 2024 conference
