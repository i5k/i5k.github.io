**i5K Coordinating Group**

**February 15, 2023**

**11:00-12:00 EST**

_Based on progress re-visioning i5K, we will attempt to come to consensus on a way forward._

_We are all very busy:_

_How can me make i5K fun, yet worthwhile__?_

**Attending:** Kevin Hackett, RJ Nowling, Glenn Hanes, Michael Branstetter, Marc Halfon, Sarthok Rahman, Chris Childers, Meg Allen, Anna Childers, Brad Coates, Jay Evans, Rob Waterhouse, Sue Brown, Josh Benoit, Kristen Panfilio

- **Meetings [brief updates, if any]**

- Arthropod Genomics Symposium 2023 (Josh). At this point, Josh could only host at a hotel, which would double the cost. Reached out to Scott (Knoxville) - they still have facilities for the last week in June, which will be more cost-effective. Mary-Ann may be able to host the symposium in Africa next year. There will be a poll to assess interest in having the meeting in Knoxville at the end of June.
- Arthropod Genomics Symposium X (AGSx) Virtual Spring Symposium 2023 (Brad)
- ICE meeting coming up in Kyoto in August 2024

- **Publications [brief updates, if needed]**
- **EBP Update (Anna)**
  - Nominations for committees are getting started - newcomers can be nominated
  - Finalized list of people for special meeting around challenges for EBP
  - Biodiversity genomics workshop will be in early October (2nd-3rd). Organized by region.
  - Thoughts about biodiversity genomics academy (training courses; software developers would lead workshops on how to use the software) â€“ ERGA already has something like this(?)
  - DToL aims to sequence 2000 species this year

- **Visioning 2023 (Kevin, Monica, Brad, Sue)**
  - Monica will share Kevin's talk outline
  - Discussion on PUIs:
    - i5k does NOT currently engage faculty at PUIs (= primarily undergrad institutions). Having projects PUIs can collaborate on that benefit the community, without generating their own data, provides professional development opportunities for undergrads.
    - There are funding opportunities that come with PUIs. These institutions have experience writing education grants. This could be a value-add! In NSF grants, you can request funding specific towards funding faculty at PUIs. Faculty and undergrads are eager for projects!
    - How do we better connect with faculty from PUIs?
    - What support do PUI faculty need for arthropod genomics?
    - **RJ could possibly be a champion for outreach to PUI. He has lots of information to help understand what PUIs need. (From Zoom chat: "My email is nowling@msoe.edu . Please reach out. (Or tell me if there is a better place to document this.)")**
    - National council for undergraduate research may be a good place to find PUIs, BUT conference has about 20k people, so may need to whittle the target down first
    - Example organization: [Genomics Education Partnership](https://thegep.org/)
  - Discussion of Kristen's schema: to do: (1) showcase flow from computational to insect user (e.g., from Rob to Kristen!); (2) feature publications and other outputs somewhere, clearly (suggestion from Kevin)

**NEXT MEETING: March 15, 2023**
