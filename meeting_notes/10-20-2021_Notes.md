- **Upcoming Meetings [brief updates]**
  - ESA, Oct 31-Nov 3, 2021: Symposium &quot;Advancing Insect Genomics through the Ag100Pest and i5K Initiatives&quot;: Can we have an i5K YouTube Channel rebroadcast? (Brad, Sheina)
    - Brad requested permission to get videos so we can put them up on YouTube - fine, but only afterwards, i.e. from Jan 2022
    - Rob to set up channel on AGC slack like we did for last year, and also advertise the upcoming ESA talks
  - PAG, Jan 8-12, 2022, San Diego: Workshop Proposals (were due Sept 3, 2021) (Brad)
    - Still very much up in the air (e.g. some not allowed to travel - can we try to push for a definitive answer so we can actually make some decisions)
    - Might consider like this year, transitioning into an AGSx online version of the session
  - i5K-Ex Situ 2022 Webinars: an alternative for those that cannot attend PAG (Brad)
    - This is probably not going to happen as organisers want people to attend PAG in person (hence transition to AGSx solution instead)
  - Arthropod Genomics Symposium, 6-12 June 2022, Notre Dame (Mary Ann)
    - Workshop 6-9 - details still to be defined
    - Meeting 9-12 - several speakers agreed already, some might have to attend virtually
    - No plans for virtual poster session per se, but probably will have a mechanism for sharing with people not on side
    - There will be a &#39;Pan-Pacific&#39; session that will likely occur during breakfast or earlier. Otherwise we can&#39;t accommodate other time zones
    - One dinner session will have 3-minute lightning talks
  - Future Meetings

- **Publications [brief update]**
  - PNAS (Anna)
    - Nothing really to report here
- **I5K Workspace at NAL: Opportunities, Challenges [15-20 min]** (Monica, Chris)
  - Some decisions about the next steps and future vision, given the current challenges and how we can find solutions
  - i5k Workspace@NAL - since 2013 - supporting genomics resources and tools for arthropod genome data (species with assemblies)
  - Community-driven gene curation - now more than 15K gene models
  - A lot of work has gone into making the data interoperable across platforms such as Ag Data Commons, NCBI, and the workspace
  - Main infrastructures = Tripal, Apollo, and Search
  - Tripal is now essentially mirroring a lot of what NCBI provides, so this could be one solution if we drop this infrastructure from our services
  - What would be the community impact of essentially removing the public-facing database part of something that is really core to what i5k is
  - Kristen - really useful resource, main use of Apollo and Search - would still be really good to be able to keep a handle on the species/content overview and help find relevant data for the community
  - Anna - important when considering what might need to go to also make sure to direct users to where they can still find this info
  - Rob - mechanisms to connect visualisations/data at NCBI with i5k@NAL pages exist (e.g. [linkouts](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/linkout/)) so we could at least still keep options for users to easily see how to navigate between resources
  - Rob - other direction =\&gt; from a gene model in Apollo can also directly link with a single click to gene page at NCBI (therefore we might not need our own gene pages etc.)
- **EBP, Oct 28-Nov 3, 2021: Debrief and take-homes for i5K [15-20 min]** (Mark, Mara, Rob and all)
  - Rob: Attended 2 workshops - well attended and went smoothly. No Slack interactions, very little interaction - likely zoom fatigue.
  - Rob&#39;s advertisements of the insect talks on Slack were helpful
  - A few new people joined the arthropod genomics community Slack

**NEXT MEETING: November 17, 2021**

**11:00-12:00 am EST**  **â€“ Note change from Daylight to Standard time**
