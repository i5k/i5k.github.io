    - Questions via the Q&amp;A function in zoom webinar
    - Possible workshop(s) after the vAGS meeting for EuPathDB and i5k annotation
    - Follow up workshops from Terrence NCBI team
  - **ESA-Orlando (Monica, Brad)**
    - Virtual meeting, format TBD
  - **PAG Ag100Pests Talks (Anna, Surya)**
  - **BioDiversity Genomics meeting (Mara)**
    - Free and virtual meeting
    - Parallel sessions and breakout groups
    - Survey (for PIs) closing tomorrow

- Project Database (Mark, Mara, fringy, Monica): ENA-based
  - Probably going to team up with DToL more closely as they seem to be more advanced with their progress
- Project Updates
  - EBP Update (fringy)
    - EBP meeting tomorrow morning
    - Informatics focus for tomorrow&#39;s meeting
    - Labs coming out of hibernation slowly
    - 100 CA ecosystem species have been chosen with \&lt;10 arthropods (spiders)
    - HIFI reads have improved assemblies drastically without a major cost impact. Saving money on AWS compute costs
    - ONT reads to compete with HIFI will be interesting but to products yet
    - Ag100Pest can help formulate DNA extraction guidelines (Anna, Brian)
  - DToL (Mark, Mara)
    - Back in the lab, a lot of arthropods coming through, are happy to &#39;send&#39; a speaker to vAGS
  - Ag100Pests, include Desert Locust (Anna)
    - funding received for genome and transcriptome
    - Coordinating with [someone] who&#39;s doing 6 locusts?
    - Murder wasp: sample from colony received, PacBio done and pretty good assembly, highly repetitive
    - Good on tiny insects you can see, once so small that you cannot see them then results are not so good
    - Releasing genomes to NCBI in June
    - Spending less than $5k per genome for genomes smaller than 1Gb if we need only 1 SMRT cell. Cost is only for consumables. No cost for personnel and compute
  - Beetles (Duane)
  - Cornome (Brad, Jay, Dave)
    - Jay: keeping beneficial insects safe in corn fields
    - 5 species coming along
    - Minute pirate bug
    - Pacbio, ONT and Illumina data for 5 species available now
    - Brian: Might need to redo the assembly with only HIFI reads
  - Bees (Brian)
    - Process in place to get things moving with Scott Geib
  - France (Denis)
  - California Ecosystem (fringy) - species are being chosen, but not many arthropods so far (fewer than 10) - there is a focus on popgen type design: 150 species plus 100 individuals per species. Brian: 20-30% reads were non-plant when seeds were not sterilised!
- Expanding the Membership on the i5K Steering Committee (Rob)
  - send new member suggestions to Kevin H.
- I5K Webinar Update (Anna): _Merge this with the i5K Steering Committee Meeting?_
  - &#39;extra&#39; talks from vAGS could be offers slots on i5k Webinar series
- New Funding Ideas
- Monica: Identification of contamination in assemblies from raw reads in SRA for false positive LGTs. Add metadata about the kinds of DNA run on the sequencer
- Future i5k coordination meetings on zoom (Monica,Kevin)

**NEXT MEETING: July 15, 2020**

**11:00-12:00 am EDT**
