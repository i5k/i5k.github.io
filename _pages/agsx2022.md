<a name="overview"></a> 
### **Overview**
Welcome to the AGSX Virtual Symposium Spring 2022.  AGSX is organized and held independent of the annual Arthropod Genomics Symposium (AGS).  Goals of the AGSX symposia are to highlight recent advances in Arthropod genomics, on topics from genome assembly, editing and engineering, and focused areas of insects as food and honey bee research.  This is an opportunity for additional exchange of ideas and community interaction. 

AGSX is composed of four separate virtual webinars from February to May, 2022. Symposia sessions are listed below, and more specific details on speakers will be updated as information becomes available.  Questions and open discussions will follow speaker presentations.

Sessions are being recorded and videos are posted within a week of when the session occurs. Once available you will be able to click "Vido Recording" at the top of the speaker information table for a link to the session's recording, available through the i5k Community YouTube Channel. Subscribe to the channel to be notified when new videos are posted.
