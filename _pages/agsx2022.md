### **Overview**
Welcome to the AGSx Virtual Symposium Spring 2022.  AGSx is organized and held independent of the annual Arthropod Genomics Symposium (AGS).  Goals of the AGSx symposia are to highlight recent advances in Arthropod genomics, on topics from genome assembly, editing and engineering, and focused areas of insects as food and honey bee research.  This is an opportunity for additional exchange of ideas and community interaction. 

AGSx is composed of four separate virtual webinars from February to May, 2022. Symposia sessions are listed below, and more specific details on speakers will be updated as information becomes available.  Questions and open discussions will follow speaker presentations.

Sessions are being recorded and videos are posted within a week of when the session occurs. Once available you will be able to click "Video Recording" at the top of the speaker information table for a link to the session's recording, available through the [i5k Community YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/i5k_community). Subscribe to the channel to be notified when new videos are posted.

Feed production accounts for 45% of greenhouse gas emissions from livestock and is prone to supply disruptions making its availability one of the biggest hurdles to achieving sustainable livestock production. Insects have the potential to increase livestock sustainability and help meet production needs by serving as an alternative protein source for animal diets. Insects are nutrient dense and can be reared sustainably in a wide variety of environments. While developing feeds from insect-based ingredients is an attractive option, more research is needed to ensure safe and reliable insect production and adoption of insect-based diets for food animal species in the United States. ARS has implemented a Grand Challenge initiative to encourage synergistic research approaches to address critical research needs. The Insect Grand Challenge initiated in 2020 includes 42 ARS scientists representing 11 National Programs and 22 Research Units across the US and Greece as well as academic partners and industry stakeholders. This team is working to develop a model that incorporates economics, food animals (poultry, aquaculture and livestock), infrastructure and sustainable ecological insect production systems to investigate the value-add of rearing insects on waste diets and quality assurance of resulting meal answering much needed research questions. Research includes innovation of insect production facilities and processing techniques, refining of insect nutrition and production, development of genetically-improved insect livestock, and optimizing inclusion of insect meal in animal diets. Data gained from this project will provide valuable information that will provide needed support to the U.S. insect industry as a new livestock commodity.<br><br>|

As it develops, and unlike traditional agriculture, there is not the time to breed optimal strains without technology, and luckily, it is readily available. This presentation will highlight some areas where genetics and genomics can play a role in increasing production value and the sustainability profile of insects for food and feed applications. <br><br>|

Alice Pinto](http://cimo.ipb.pt/cimo/web/index.php?r=olderresearcher/view&id=46)__ <br><br>Coordinator Professor in the School of Agriculture at the Polyethnic Institute of Bragança, Portugal |<br>__Title:__ Iberia: an important stage of honey bee, Apis mellifera, evolution<br><br>__Summary:__ The origin of the honey bee, *Apis mellifera*, has been under debate with two competing hypotheses placing it in either Africa or Asia. In both scenarios, Iberia seems to have acted as an important stage in *A. mellifera* evolutionary history because of its close proximity to Africa and because it was an important refuge during the ice ages.  Therefore, uncovering the Iberian honey bee (*A.m. iberiensis*) diversity patterns, and underlying processes, is also revealing an important component of the *A. mellifera* history. Here, I will show the results of a genome-wide scan and whole genome analysis to disentangle selective and neutral patterns of population structure across the entire range of the Iberian honey bee. It will be evident that selection and secondary contact have acted together to shape extant diversity patterns and that contemporary human-mediated processes seem to play a negligible role, despite large-scale migratory beekeeping. I will highlight the questions that remain unanswered in the Iberian honey bee history and the importance of a full knowledge of diversity patterns when designing SNP-based tools. <br><br>|

While much energy has focused on queens, we are increasingly discovering that drones play a more important role in queen quality than originally expected. If drones are not producing healthy sperm, their mates will not produce healthy colonies. We are beginning to understand the proximate causes of variation in of honey bee male (drone) fertility; however, the ultimate causes remain elusive. My work will explore how genetic variation within North America can influence reproductive quality in honeybee males. In this talk, I discuss how both haploid selection and polyandry impact the evolution, divergence and genetic diversity of male reproductive genes. I also discuss how these factors contribute to the phenotypic variation in drone reproductive traits observed among honey bee stocks in North America. <br><br>|

The existing simulators focus either on common livestock or crop species and are not suitable for honeybees due to their genetic, reproductive, and environmental specificities. While honeybee specific simulators have been developed, they operate on a colony level and usually do not model the seasonal cycle of a colony. We have developed an R package SIMplyBee that provides honeybee extensions for the AlphaSimR simulator. SIMplyBee operates on an individual level but with colony and colonies classes, with the latter representing either an apiary or an entire population of colonies. SIMplyBee provides functionality for simulating genomes, genetic and phenotypic values at an individual as well as the colony level. It also includes the functionality to model colony events throughout the year and across years. For example, SIMplyBee enables the user to simulate major events, such as creating drone congregation areas, mating of the queen, swarming, supersedure, split, build-up of the colony, and collapse of the colony. SIMplyBee also allows for the monitoring of genetic and phenotypic trends, as well as genetic variability of the colony or population. In addition, it simulates the csd locus with flexible number of alleles and allows for elimination of homozygous drones. In its final form, SIMplyBee will also include a spatial component of honeybee populations to account for dynamics related to natural mating or environmental effects, and allow for simulating multiple subspecies of honeybees. In this talk, I will present the functionality of the simulator and the results from some early-stage simulations. <br><br>|
