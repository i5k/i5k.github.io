### **Overview**
Welcome to the AGSX Virtual Symposium Spring 2022.  AGSX is organized and held independent of the annual Arthropod Genomics Symposium (AGS).  Goals of the AGSX symposia are to highlight recent advances in Arthropod genomics, on topics from genome assembly, editing and engineering, and focused areas of insects as food and honey bee research.  This is an opportunity for additional exchange of ideas and community interaction. 

AGSX is composed of four separate virtual webinars from February to May, 2022. Symposia sessions are listed below, and more specific details on speakers will be updated as information becomes available.  Questions and open discussions will follow speaker presentations.

Sessions are being recorded and videos are posted within a week of when the session occurs. Once available you will be able to click "Vido Recording" at the top of the speaker information table for a link to the session's recording, available through the i5k Community YouTube Channel. Subscribe to the channel to be notified when new videos are posted.

| __Session 1: Insect Genomic Technologies to Improve Food Applications__ | __February 9, 2022 10am-12pm CST/11am-1pm EST/5-7pm CET__ |

| __Kelsy Robinson__ <br><br>Research Biologist (Immunology), USDA ARS Poultry Research Unit, Mississippi |<br>__Title:__ Debugging a new mini livestock commodity: Advancing insects a feed through a USDA Grand Challenge research approach<br><br>__Summary:__ A steady increase in global population, food insecurity issues, and global warming demands an increased food/feed output from available agro-ecosystems while decreasing environmental impact. Feed production accounts for 45% of greenhouse gas emissions from livestock and is prone to supply disruptions making its availability one of the biggest hurdles to achieving sustainable livestock production. Insects have the potential to increase livestock sustainability and help meet production needs by serving as an alternative protein source for animal diets. Insects are nutrient dense and can be reared sustainably in a wide variety of environments. While developing feeds from insect-based ingredients is an attractive option, more research is needed to ensure safe and reliable insect production and adoption of insect-based diets for food animal species in the United States. ARS has implemented a Grand Challenge initiative to encourage synergistic research approaches to address critical research needs. The Insect Grand Challenge initiated in 2020 includes 42 ARS scientists representing 11 National Programs and 22 Research Units across the US and Greece as well as academic partners and industry stakeholders. This team is working to develop a model that incorporates economics, food animals (poultry, aquaculture and livestock), infrastructure and sustainable ecological insect production systems to investigate the value-add of rearing insects on waste diets and quality assurance of resulting meal answering much needed research questions. Research includes innovation of insect production facilities and processing techniques, refining of insect nutrition and production, development of genetically-improved insect livestock, and optimizing inclusion of insect meal in animal diets. Data gained from this project will provide valuable information that will provide needed support to the U.S. insect industry as a new livestock commodity.<br><br>|
| __Christine J. Picard__ <br><br>Associate Professor, Biology and Director, Forensic and Investigative Sciences (FIS) Program, Indiana University–Purdue University Indianapolis, Indianapolis, IN |<br>__Title:__ Genetic and genomic selection in insects as food and feed<br><br>__Summary:__ The insect agriculture industry is poised to be the sustainable alternative protein of the future. As it develops, and unlike traditional agriculture, there is not the time to breed optimal strains without technology, and luckily, it is readily available. This presentation will highlight some areas where genetics and genomics can play a role in increasing production value and the sustainability profile of insects for food and feed applications. <br><br>|
