# How do I get started learning computational biology?

Here is a sampling of the many free resources available that cover a variety of topics from learning command line operations to best practices for both coding and data analysis.  Some resources cited below may have a fee associated with some proportion of their offerings or require a fee in order to gain official certification.

[Intro to Unix Command Line](http://www.hpc.iastate.edu/guides/unix-introduction)
<br>This website has a short Unix introduction and eight tutorials (see the left side bar) that walk through numerous useful command line methods. 

[Software Carpentry](http://software-carpentry.org/lessons/)
<br>Best practices in scientific computing ranging from command line, version control and databases to programming languages like R and Python.

[Data Carpentry](http://www.datacarpentry.org/)
<br>Skills for data management and analysis. The lessons are meant to assist with data management in fields ranging from life and physical sciences to social science.

[Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/catalog/subject/data-science)
<br>Interactive lessons in Python programming and other topics.

[Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/)
<br>An online course provider with a large breadth of courses, often with many options for any given topic and not limited to computational skills.  Courses of interest under the [Bioinformatics](https://www.coursera.org/browse/life-sciences/bioinformatics) umbrella might be [Bioinformatics Methods I](https://www.coursera.org/learn/bioinformatics-methods-1) and [Genomic Data Science with Galaxy](https://www.coursera.org/learn/galaxy-project).

[edX](https://www.edx.org/)
<br>Another online course provider with some bioinformatics focused courses like [Analyze your Genome!](https://www.edx.org/course/analyze-genome-uc-san-diegox-binf180-1), [DNA Sequences: Alignments and Analysis](https://www.edx.org/course/dna-sequences-alignments-analysis-usmx-umuc-bif001x-1) and [Statistical Analysis in Bioinformatics](https://www.edx.org/course/statistical-analysis-bioinformatics-usmx-umuc-bif003x-0).

[Rosalind](http://rosalind.info/about/)
<br>Learn bioinformatics through problem solving.  Problems are based on molecular biology issues and vary in complexity and difficulty.

[DataCamp](https://www.datacamp.com/courses)
<br>Courses in Python, R, shell and Git as well as other data science topics like data manipulation and visualization.  Both free and subscription based offerings.

[Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/packt/offers/free-learning)
<br>Ebooks and videos for learning about numerous technology topics.  As a bonus, this site offers one free programming ebook each day as well as many other permanently free ebooks.

[Bioinformatics Workbook](https://isugenomics.github.io/bioinformatics-workbook/)
<br>Introduction to bioinformatics, experimental design, and data acquisition, wrangling and analysis as well as best practices for _de novo_ and reference based RNAseq analysis.
