|October&nbsp;5,&nbsp;2016 |<br>__Speaker:__ Jonas Korlach, Chief Scientific Officer, and Sarah Kingan, Senior Scientist Bioinformatics, Pacific Biosciences<br><br>__Title:__ High-Quality De Novo Insect Genome Assemblies using PacBio Sequencing<br><br>__Summary:__ PacBio Sequencing is characterized by very long sequence reads (average >10,000 bases), lack of GC-bias, and high consensus accuracy. These features have allowed the method to provide a new gold standard in de novo genome assemblies, producing highly contiguous (contig N50 > 1 Mb) and accurate (> QV 50) genome assemblies. We will briefly describe the technology and then highlight the full workflow, from sample preparation through sequencing to data analysis, on examples of insect genome assemblies, and illustrate the difference these high-quality genomes represent with regard to biological insights, compared to fragmented draft assemblies generated by short-read sequencing.<br><br>__[Slides](webinar_slides/i5K_webinar_PacBio_Oct5_2016.pdf)__<br>__[Video Recording](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAMAc4gGIlQ)__<br><br>|

|January&nbsp;4,&nbsp;2017|<br>__Speaker:__ Dr. Scott Emrich, UND Director of Bioinformatics; Depts. of Computer Science and Engineering and Biological Sciences (concurrent), University of Notre Dame; contact PI, NIH/NIAID VectorBase, a Bioinformatics Resource Center (BRC)<br><br>__Title:__ Non-model arthropod assembly:  past, present and future<br><br>__Summary:__ Over 40 important arthropod vectors have been sequenced and placed into VectorBase.  I will present general principles of genome assembly and analysis ranging from (inbred) colonies to more recent work on field-sourced individuals.  Based on these multiple consortium efforts, I will provide information on how to take full advantage of informatics resources available, including but not limited to VectorBase and overcoming potential road-blocks finding or submitting non-model genome data.  Finally, I will share emerging results efforts, including my own, to improve genome assemblies of important mosquito vectors using data discussed in other i5K webinars in this series.<br><br>__[Slides](webinar_slides/i5k_webinar_VectorBase_01_04_2017.pdf)__<br>__[Video Recording](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylXuIjD0dvE)__<br><br>|
|February&nbsp;1,&nbsp;2017|<br>__Speaker:__ Prof. Evgeny M. Zdobnov and Dr Robert M. Waterhouse, University of Geneva Medical School & Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics, Geneva, Switzerland<br><br>__Title:__ OrthoDB: an evolutionary perspective to interpreting genomics data<br><br>__Summary:__ Orthology is a cornerstone of comparative genomics, and such approaches are well-established as immensely valuable for gene discovery and characterization, offering evolutionarily-qualified hypotheses on gene function by identifying “equivalent” genes in different species.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The OrthoDB hierarchical catalogue of orthologues represents a comprehensive resource of comparative genomics data that delineates the evolutionary histories of millions of genes from thousands of species.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;OrthoDB resources and tools enable extensive orthology-based genome annotation and interpretation in a comparative genomics framework that incorporates the growing numbers of sequenced genomes.<br><br>__[Slides](webinar_slides/i5K_webinar_OrthoDBFeb_01_2017.pdf)__<br>__[Video Recording](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cswNRFLMTN4)__<br><br>|
|March&nbsp;1,&nbsp;2017|<br>__Speaker:__ Dr. Sven Bocklandt, Senior Application Specialist, Bionano Genomics<br><br>__Title:__ Improve genome accuracy and contiguity using Bionano Next-Generation Mapping<br><br>__Summary:__ Generating high quality finished genomes remains challenging. Many genomes are highly repetitive, and NGS has led to incomplete assemblies that contain large numbers of contigs and limited long-range information. <br>Bionano images extremely long molecules, from 150 kbp to megabase pairs in length, to reveal the true long-range structure of the genome. We will discuss how Bionano’s de novo genome maps can increase the contiguity of assemblies up to 100-fold over NGS alone. Because it is the only non-sequencing based scaffolding method, it can error correct assemblies. We will also discuss the difficulties and recent progress in detecting large structural variation.<br><br>__[Slides](/webinar_slides/i5K_webinar_Bionano_Mar_01_2017.pdf)__<br>__[Video Recording](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSYHJMqtJmc)__<br><br>|
|April&nbsp;5,&nbsp;2017|<br>__Speaker:__ Dr. Keith R. Hopper, Research Entomologist, Beneficial Insect Introductions Research Unit, USDA-ARS, Newark, Delaware<br><br>__Title:__ Phylogenetics and quantitative genetics of host specificity in aphid parasitoids in the genus Aphelinus<br><br>__Summary:__ Differences in parasitism success among potential host species can provide strong selection for divergence and speciation in parasitic Hymenoptera. Here we report research on the genomics and genetics of host specificity in Aphelinus species. We have sequenced, assembled, and annotated the genomes and transcriptomes of >10 Aphelinus species.  Using coding sequences, we developed a robust phylogeny, onto which we mapped parasitism of diverse species of aphids. For some aphid species, parasitism was phylogenetically conserved, with closely related parasitoids showing similar levels of parasitism. For other aphid species, parasitism diverged between closely related parasitoids, consistent with host-driven speciation. To explore the genetic architecture of differences in host specificity, we crossed and backcrossed A. atriplicis, which readily parasitizes Diuraphis noxia, with A. certus, which rarely parasitizes this aphid. Using genetic markers from reduced-representation genomic libraries, we mapped quantitative trait loci (QTL) affecting parasitism of D. noxia. We found eight QTL (six of which interacted in their effects) that explained 39% of the variation in parasitism D. noxia among backcross females. To help identify candidate genes, we compared the genomes and transcriptomes of these parasitoid species to find proteins that diverged in sequence or expression, and we tested whether these divergent loci mapped to QTL affecting parasitism of D. noxia. So far, we have found 15 divergent genes that mapped to parasitism QTL or significantly affected parasitism by themselves. These are among the first results on the genetic architecture of host specificity in parasitic wasps.<br><br>__[Slides](/webinar_slides/i5K_webinar_K_Hopper_Apr_05_2017.pdf)__<br>__[Video Recording](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pT5BIHG2ekg)__<br><br>|
|May&nbsp;3,&nbsp;2017|<br>__Speaker:__ Dr. Kevin Hackett, i5k Co-chair<br><br>__Summary:__ Discussion of the Earth BioGenome Project (EBP) including: 1) How getting folks to identify with i5K and EBP can lift all boats; 2) Why we need to invest in genomics infrastructure such as i5K and EBP, in contrast to spending all funding in hypothesis-driven research. <br><br>|
|June&nbsp;7,&nbsp;2017|<br>Wonderful to see everyone at the [10th Annual Arthropod Genomics Symposium and VectorBase Workshop](http://globalhealth.nd.edu/10th-annual-arthropod-genomics-symposium/), which was held from June 7 - June 10, 2017 at the University of Notre Dame.<br><br>|
|July&nbsp;5,&nbsp;2017|<br>__Speaker:__ Gerard Coyne, Senior Technical Applications Specialist, Oxford Nanopore Technologies<br><br>__Title:__ Real time DNA sequencing using Oxford Nanopore Technologies 'nanopore sensing' platform<br><br>__Summary:__ Oxford Nanopore Technologies has developed a disruptive platform for the direct, electronic analysis of single molecules.  Our instruments the MinION (TM) and the PromethION (TM) are adaptable for the detection and analysis of a range of analytes that include DNA, RNA, proteins and small molecules.  At the heart of our platform is a biological protein called a 'nanopore'.  A single nanopore create a hole in a membrane made from a proprietary synthetic polymer.  An electric potential is applied across the membrane resulting in a current flowing only through the aperture of the nanopore.  Single molecules that enter the nanopore cause characteristic disruptions in the current, by measuring these disruptions single molecules from a sample are identified.  The MinION is a small device that is designed for portability and simplicity of its workflow.  The MinION plugs into a standard PC or laptop using the USB port.  The PromethION is a standalone high throughput benchtop instrument that provides the flexibility to run 100's of samples in an asynchronous manner.  This allows for large projects that requires the flexibility and throughput to interrogate complex eukaryotic genomes.  Oxford Nanopore is integrating the data produced by the MinION and PromethION into a cloud-based analytics company, Metrichor.  Metrichor is powered by its EPI2ME platform.  Metrichor is providing tools to automate data analysis workflows to help people track, trend and predict biological data resulting in real time actionable interpretation of their data.  Users of the technology have access to our 'Nanopore Community’.  The Nanopore Community helps new users get started with technical documentation as well as user driven forums and encourages discussion and collaborative experimentation using our technology.  There is a growing list of publications on the many uses for our nanopore sensing platform that include field based applications, real time pathogen detection and surveillance, metagenomics analysis, anti-microbial resistance detection, education and many more including sequencing on the International Space Station.<br><br>No slides or presentation recording made available.|
|August&nbsp;2nd,&nbsp;2017 |<br>__Speaker:__ Brandon Rice, Head of Development and Strategy, Dovetail Genomics <br><br>__Title:__ Heaps of Chromosomes, New Scales and Evolving Paradigms in Genome Assembly<br><br>__Summary:__ The field of genomics has arrived at an inflection point in its history for its most fundamental resource: genome assemblies. Genome assembly is increasingly stream-lined and the results of increasingly outstanding quality, with chromosome-scale assemblies as the new standard. At Dovetail we aim to drive genome assemblies to full commoditization; focus on your science, not on the vagaries of sequencing technologies and analysis approaches. Come hear about the tool-kit and processes we have assembled and those we’re developing to increase focus on science over assembly as the focus of genomics for every organism.<br><br>__Bonus Presentation from User Perspective__ <br>__Speaker:__ Dr. Brenda Oppert, Research Molecular Biologist, Center for Grain and Animal Health Research, Stored Product Insect and Engineering Research Unit, USDA-ARS, Manhattan, Kansas<br><br>__Title:__ Reading through the repeats: Dovetail technology improves assembly of insect genomes<br><br>__[Slides](webinar_slides/i5k_webinar_Dovetail_08_02_2017.pdf)__<br>__[Video Recording](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TneDnO_doOw)__<br><br>|
