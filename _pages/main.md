## ****News****
## Join us at the Entomology 2019 meeting for the member symposium "Preparing to Sequence the Planet - Starting with our Insect Friends" 
Insect genomes are critical for performing cutting-edge entomological research. The Earth BioGenome Project provides an opportunity to coordinate larger-scale genome sequencing projects, with the ultimate goal to accelerate biological research. This symposium will inform and foster discussion on how and why to sequence a representative from all extant arthropod families.
* Symposium place, date and time: America's Center - Room 241; Sunday, November 17, 2019 08:00 AM - 12:00 PM.
* For more information about the ESA meeting and program: [https://www.entsoc.org/events/annual-meeting](https://www.entsoc.org/events/annual-meeting)
