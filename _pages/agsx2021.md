### **Overview**
Welcome to the AGSX Virtual Symposium Spring 2021.  AGSX is organized and held independent of the annual Arthropod Genomics Symposium (AGS).  Goals of the AGSX symposia are to highlight recent advances in Arthropod genomics, on topics from genome assembly, editing and engineering, and focused areas of insects as food and honey bee research.  This is an opportunity for additional exchange of ideas and community interaction. 

AGSX is composed of four separate virtual webinars from February to May, 2021. Symposia sessions are listed below, and more specific details on speakers will be updated as information becomes available.  Questions and open discussions will follow speaker presentations.

Sessions are being recorded and videos are posted within a week of when the session occurs. Click "Vido Recording" at the top of the speaker information table for a link to the session's recording, available through the i5k Community YouTube Channel. Subscribe to the channel to be notified when new videos are posted.

(Diptera: Stratiomyidae), the Black Soldier Fly (BSF) is an increasingly important mass reared resource for bioconversion of organic material into animal feed. We generated a high-quality chromosome-scale genome assembly of the BSF using Pacific Bioscience, 10X Genomics linked read and high-throughput chromosome conformation capture sequencing technology. Scaffolding the final assembly with Hi-C data produced a highly contiguous 1.01 Gb genome with 99.75% of scaffolds assembled into pseudo-chromosomes representing seven chromosomes with 16.01 Mb contig and 180.46 Mb scaffold N50 values. The highly complete genome obtained a BUSCO completeness of 98.6%. We masked 67.32% of the genome as repetitive sequences and annotated a total of 17,664 protein-coding genes using the BRAKER2 pipeline. We analyzed an established lab population to investigate the genomic variation and architecture of the BSF revealing six autosomes and the identification of an X chromosome. We have been using this genome to conduct whole genome resequencing of strains from around the world, showing marked divergence between captive strains and wild strains that are more closely related to South American wild strains. Release of this novel chromosome-scale BSF genome assembly will provide an improved platform for further genomic studies and functional characterization of candidate regions of artificial selection.<br><br>|

One such alternative is insect-derived protein for both direct and indirect (via animal feed) human consumption. Crickets (family: Gryllidae) are an especially popular group of edible insects due to their nutritional quality and palatability. However, we know little about the diseases that are impacting the health of this emerging insect crop. Here, I identified, characterized, and quantified a pathogenic virus isolated from a colony of lab-reared decorated crickets (Gryllodes sigillatus) using various molecular and genomic techniques. I will discuss these results and highlight the future considerations necessary for ensuring the health of farmed insects.<br><br>|

Despite this potential, genomic tools have rarely been used in biocontrol agents of invasive plants. The case of four tamarisk beetle species, *Diorhabda carinata*, *D. carinulata*, *D. elongata*, and *D. sublineata* (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae), biocontrol agents introduced to control the invasive woody shrub Tamarix in North America, provide a system to examine the genomic mechanisms and consequences of invasion. While the novel range of *D. carinulata* has expanded beyond previous photoperiodic limits in < 15 generations, wide-spread hybridization of *D. carinata*, *D. elongata*, and *D. sublineata* has also been documented. I will present the development of genomic resources and ongoing research to understand how these two simultaneous processes may impact efficacy and safety of the biocontrol program. We developed high-quality chromosome-level reference genomes in collaboration with Ag100Pest, conducted genome-wide analysis of hybridization and range expansion from hundreds of individuals, and have begun to identify genetic variation associated with ecologically-relevant phenotypes. Our work can serve as a case-study for development and use of genomic tools to study arthropods in novel environments.<br><br>|

Despite this simplicity, researchers have been largely unsuccessful in explaining why some clades display near stasis in chromosome number while others exhibit variation even among closely related species. We have developed a biologically realistic chromosome evolution model that allows us to test many long-standing verbal hypotheses. Results from applying this model in insects suggest that changes to chromosome number are deleterious and may often fix due to drift and that in some clades sexual antagonism may be a key driver of changes in chromosome number.<br><br>|

Benoit](http://insectphysiology.uc.edu/)__ <br><br>University of Cincinnati, Cincinnati, OH |<br>__Title:__ Unique facets of sex and reproduction in insects identified through combined use of multiomic and functional studies<br><br>__Summary:__ Sexual aspects and reproduction of insect systems have significant variation that range from diverse mechanisms of pre-copulatory interactions to unique processes for allocation of nutrients to developing progeny. This seminar will feature three vignettes where combined proteomic, transcriptomic, and genomic methods followed by directed functional studies have been used to establish unique factors underlying copulation, viviparous reproduction, and external provisioning of nutrients to developing offspring. The insect systems discussed will be viviparous cockroaches and flies, the Antarctic midge, and a non-model fruit fly species.<br><br>|

Extreme recombination rates are also observed in other social insects but not in related solitary species. Although a number of theories have been proposed, the evolutionary explanation for these elevated recombination rates is unclear. High recombination rates also have important implications for molecular evolution and interpretation of genomic data in honeybees. Here I will discuss studies of the evolution of recombination in bees using both direct inference of crossover events in haploid drones and statistical inference based on patterns of linkage disequilibrium.<br><br>|

Here I aim to highlight some of the different approaches we have used to help unravel the genomic mechanisms involved in the evolution and maintenance of sociality and division of labour.<br><br>|
