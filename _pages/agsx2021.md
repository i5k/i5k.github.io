### **Overview**
Welcome to the AGSX Virtual Symposium Spring 2021.  AGSX is organized and held independent of the annual Arthropod Genomics Symposium (AGS).  Goals of the AGSX symposia are to highlight recent advances in Arthropod genomics, on topics from genome assembly, editing and engineering, and focused areas of insects as food and honey bee research.  This is an opportunity for additional exchange of ideas and community interaction. 

AGSX is composed of four separate virtual webinars from February to May, 2021. Symposia sessions are listed below, and more specific details on speakers will be updated as information becomes available.  Questions and open discussions will follow speaker presentations.

| __[Chris Jiggins](https://heliconius.zoo.cam.ac.uk/people/chris-jiggins/)__ <br><br>Professor of Evolutionary Biology, Department of Zoology, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK |<br>__Title:__ A high-quality, chromosome-level genome assembly of the Black Soldier Fly (*Hermetia Illucens* L.) and its use in characterising global genetic diversity<br><br>__Summary:__ *Hermetia illucens* L. (Diptera: Stratiomyidae), the Black Soldier Fly (BSF) is an increasingly important mass reared resource for bioconversion of organic material into animal feed. We generated a high-quality chromosome-scale genome assembly of the BSF using Pacific Bioscience, 10X Genomics linked read and high-throughput chromosome conformation capture sequencing technology. Scaffolding the final assembly with Hi-C data produced a highly contiguous 1.01 Gb genome with 99.75% of scaffolds assembled into pseudo-chromosomes representing seven chromosomes with 16.01 Mb contig and 180.46 Mb scaffold N50 values. The highly complete genome obtained a BUSCO completeness of 98.6%. We masked 67.32% of the genome as repetitive sequences and annotated a total of 17,664 protein-coding genes using the BRAKER2 pipeline. We analyzed an established lab population to investigate the genomic variation and architecture of the BSF revealing six autosomes and the identification of an X chromosome. We have been using this genome to conduct whole genome resequencing of strains from around the world, showing marked divergence between captive strains and wild strains that are more closely related to South American wild strains. Release of this novel chromosome-scale BSF genome assembly will provide an improved platform for further genomic studies and functional characterization of candidate regions of artificial selection.<br><br>|

One such alternative is insect-derived protein for both direct and indirect (via animal feed) human consumption. Crickets (family: Gryllidae) are an especially popular group of edible insects due to their nutritional quality and palatability. However, we know little about the diseases that are impacting the health of this emerging insect crop. Here, I identified, characterized, and quantified a pathogenic virus isolated from a colony of lab-reared decorated crickets (Gryllodes sigillatus) using various molecular and genomic techniques. I will discuss these results and highlight the future considerations necessary for ensuring the health of farmed insects.<br><br>|
