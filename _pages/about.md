## **[Vision](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1uhuxG8V3_Tf8RdjgU1NijJ1J7vA1eoAy/view){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}**
As members of the global genomics community, ensure that all insect and other arthropod scientists have access to reference-quality insect and arthropod genomes, and the information needed to perform the highest quality science with these genomes. 
 
## **Mission**
* Promote best practices for genomic research projects;
* Support generation, access, analysis, visualization, and understanding of genomic AND post-genomic data 
* Present recommendations to fundholders for the support needed to provide new opportunities for arthropod genomics in addressing fundamental research questions. 

## **Working Groups**
__Executive Committee__<br>
     [Monica Poelchau](https://www.ars.usda.gov/people-locations/person?person-id=50213){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}, [Sue Brown](https://www.k-state.edu/biology/about/people/faculty/brown/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}, [Brad Coates](https://www.ars.usda.gov/people-locations/person?person-id=1047){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}, [Marc Halfon](https://medicine.buffalo.edu/faculty/profile.html?ubit=mshalfon){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}, [Duane McKenna](https://www.memphis.edu/biology/people/faculty/duane-mckenna.php){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}
- Guides i5k’s general direction and governance

__Community Building and Outreach__<br>
- Coordinates conferences and special symposium
- Manages outreach on social media platforms
- Responds to community requests
  
__Genome Project Coordination__<br>
- Coordinates genome project submission to [GoaT](https://goat.genomehubs.org/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}
- Advocates for enhancements to GoaT and implements mechanisms for the status of all arthropod genome projects from the i5k Community to be reported on GoaT under the i5k Initiative's umbrella, while clearly crediting the effort to the research group or lab responsible for the project
  
__Standards__<br>
- Curates guidance on genome project standards and best practices
- Evaluates gaps in standards and best practices, especially those impacting arthropod research
- Advocates for standards and best practices that enable success by recognizing the challenges and special considerations needed for some arthropod species
  
__Training__<br>
- Coordinates and curates training modules based on the needs of the i5k Community

## **Affiliated Projects**
Arthropod genome assemblies and associated data can be accessed, visualized, curated and disseminated through many community genome [databases and portals](/share).

Data associated with the i5k Initiative is archived under the [BioProject PRJNA163993](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/163993){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}.

Arthropod pests of US field crops, livestock, bees, trees, rangeland and stored products as well as foreign pest species considered potential invasive threats to US agriculture are included. Ag100Pest is led by the USDA’s Agricultural Research Service. <br><br> [BioProject PRJNA555319](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/555319){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} <br><br> \*Photo by [WanderingMogwai, CC BY-SA 4.0](https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=121511770){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}|

Species have been selected based on taxonomic diversity, geographic area, conservation status, agricultural importance, biological diversity, and other factors. The data will be used to improve knowledge of U.S. bees at the genomic level and to facilitate research in bee management, health, and conservation. The project is being led by the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign and the U.S. Department of Agriculture, Agricultural Research Service (USDA-ARS). <br><br> [BioProject PRJNA923301](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA923301){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} |
