<a name="overview"></a> 
### **Overview**
Welcome to the AGSx Virtual Symposium Spring 2023.  AGSx is organized and held independent of the annual Arthropod Genomics Symposium (AGS).  Goals of the AGSx symposia are to highlight recent advances in Arthropod genomics, on topics from genome assembly, editing and engineering, and focused areas of insects as food and honey bee research.  This is an opportunity for additional exchange of ideas and community interaction. 

AGSx 2023 is composed of three separate virtual webinars from March to May. Symposia sessions are listed below, and more specific details on speakers will be updated as information becomes available.  Questions and open discussions will follow speaker presentations.

Sessions are being recorded and videos are posted within a week of when the session occurs. Once available you will be able to click "Video Recording" at the top of the speaker information table for a link to the session's recording, available through the [i5k Community YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/i5k_community). Subscribe to the channel to be notified when new videos are posted.

However to have a worldwide impact on feed and food alimentation, the production must scale up at industrialization phase and deliver several kilotons of insect proteins per year. This production objective implies an important concentration of individuals in the same place, leading to deal with the genetic diversity and the performance of the strains currently farmed. The long range success of the insect farming industry requires a deep understanding of *Tenebrio molitor* genetic dimension. However several innovations, in both area of genetics/genomics and automated phenotyping solutions are necessary to develop an efficient selection scheme. That's why Ÿnsect is leading an ambitious 6 year R&D program called ŸnFABRE, in collaboration with the CEA, Thermo-Fisher and Aprex-Solutions. The main objective of this project is to develop all the required tools to propose a genomic selection scheme adapted to our industrial farming conditions. Four main traits will be selected across generations: reproduction, growth, food efficiency and disease resistance. The first year of the project has seen the construction of the population of reference, regrouping 4,000 phenotyped individuals. This population was generated through single pair matings (1 vs 1) by choosing male and female as distantly related as possible. About 700 couples were mated per generation and 3 generations were needed to form this reference population under pedigree. Several phenotypes have been assessed, a part of them characterized the couple (daily or total egg laying count, hatching rate, larval growth or feed efficiency) and another part was uniquely linked to individual (pupae - imago - adult weight, sex identification or developmental time egg to pupae). After the laying period, the adults were flash-frozen and DNA extracted. A subset have been fully sequenced, identifying all the SNP candidates to produce the genotyping HD array (~700K), and the rest will be genotyped. The genetic study highlighted a part of the variability of assessed phenotypes directly linked to additive genetic effect. Indeed, heritabilities ranged between 0.21 to 0.45 for reproduction phenotypes, 0.12 to 0.57 for growth parameters and 0.20 to 0.46 for developmental time according to the parameter studied. While waiting for the genotyping results and the calculating of GEBVs, this genetic study will allow us to establish the first lines selected for traits of interest based on EBVs.<br><br>|

The main focus has been on rearing conditions and mass production, and currently we can see that genetics is getting the attention. Besides, Black Soldier fly is emerging as the top species for feed as it valorises the waste stream. This presentation showcases the work done in Beta Bugs, an insect genetics company, alongside Roslin Institute, during the past year. The main focus has been putting in place processes and strategies alongside technology tools, enabling us to implement selective breeding and standardise practices in a novel sector in which there is not an ABC of how a breeding programme should be implemented and we are learning as we go.<br><br>|
