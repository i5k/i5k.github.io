### **Overview**
Welcome to the AGSx Virtual Symposium Spring 2024.  AGSx is organized and held independent of the annual Arthropod Genomics Symposium (AGS).  Goals of the AGSx symposia are to highlight recent advances in Arthropod genomics, on topics from genome assembly, editing and engineering, and focused areas of insects as food and honey bee research.  This is an opportunity for additional exchange of ideas and community interaction. 

AGSx 2024 is composed of four separate virtual webinars occuring between February and May. Symposia sessions are listed below, and more specific details on speakers will be updated as information becomes available.  Questions and open discussions will follow speaker presentations.

Sessions will be recorded. Once available you will be able to click "Video Recording" at the top of the speaker information table for a link to the session's recording, available through the [i5k Community YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/i5k_community). Subscribe to the channel to be notified when new videos are posted.

While some insects are farmed, others are harvested in the wild from forests or agricultural fields. As of right now, there are no established laboratory procedures to verify the identity of insect products sold as food or feed. The use of a Metagenomic Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) method to identify whole insects and products derived from insects that are marketed as food or food ingredients will be the main topic of this presentation. The safety concerns related to insects as food will also be briefly covered in this presentation. <br><br>|

When specific microorganisms are provided as a dietary supplement, insect reproduction, food conversion and growth are enhanced and health is improved in cases of nutritional deficiency or pathogen infection. Insectâ€“microbiota interactions and the presence of beneficial microbes play an essential role in preserving insect health. Probiotic provision to insects reared for food and feed purposes could decrease the incidence of environmental and biological stress in mass-rearing conditions. A workflow for selecting bacterial strains for insect species reared for food and feed is proposed along with methods used to isolate and measure the effectiveness of a probiotic. A last discussion is focused on future perspectives on probiotic applications in mass-reared insects and the role of microbiota in preserving insect health. <br><br>|

Advances in breeding can accelerate the establishment of the quality traits that will drive the success of farmed insect populations, this includes the development of tools to measure and record relevant performance data. For example, biomarkers can be developed to measure the presence, progression or predisposition of particular conditions to gain valuable insights in the overall health of the insects reared for animal feed. This presentation will discuss potential biomarkers for studying various conditions important in the commercial farming of the black soldier fly (BSF) (*Hermetia illucens*). <br><br>|

| <img src="/images/AGSx2024_speaker_Verster.png"/> __[Kirsten Verster](https://hadlylab.stanford.edu/people/kirsten-verster)__ <br><br>Postdoctoral Scholar, Stanford University, Stanford, California USA|<br>__Title:__ A toxic triangle: how insects co-opted phage genes for defense against deadly wasps<br><br>__Summary:__ Several disease-causing bacteria produce toxins that damage host cells by triggering preprogrammed cell death. Two such bacterial toxins are called cytolethal distending toxin B and apoptosis-inducing protein of 56 kDa. We discovered that diverse insect species coopted the two bacterial genes encoding each cytotoxin through a phenomenon called horizontal gene transfer (HGT). HGT occurs when a gene from one organism is inserted into the genome of another and then is stably inherited across generations. We found that these two bacterial toxin genes were captured by species in the *Drosophila ananassae* subgroup, which are highly resistant to parasitoid wasps, and we observe that *D. ananassae* lines carrying null mutations of these genes are more susceptible to parasitoid infection than the wild type. We conclude that toxin cargo genes were captured by these insects millions of years ago and integrated as novel anti-parasitoid modules in their innate immune system. <br><br>|

Most species are thought to have XY sex chromosomes although variation exists within the group. Until recently, it was unclear if the X chromosome was conserved over evolutionary time in beetles and if the X might have taken on unique properties that set it apart from the autosomes. In this talk, I will detail comparative analyses looking at sex chromosome evolution in beetles and will discuss work we have been doing exploring the tempo of sex chromosome differentiation after sex chromosomes fuse to autosomes. These so-called neo-sex chromosomes provide a unique opportunity to study how X and Y chromosomes differentiate from one another and evolve changes in gene content, gene expression, and transposable element abundance. These genomic changes could potentially lay the foundation for the evolution of reproductive isolation between populations, thereby allowing new species to form. <br><br>|

Chromosome number is a fundamental genomic trait that is often the first recorded characteristic of a genome. We observe striking heterogeneity in the range of chromosome numbers among clades across the tree of life. This tells us that there must be great heterogeneity in rates of chromosome number evolution among lineages. Despite recent developments in comparative methods, most of this heterogeneity is still poorly understood. Our lab has developed a comparative method that allows for a binary trait to coevolve with and impact rates of chromosome number evolution. This comparative method allows us to identify coevolving traits that lead to heterogeneity in rates of chromosome number across the tree of life. For example, this method has allowed us to look at the fitness effect of mutations that change chromosome number in beetles as well as the impact of segregation mechanisms on chromosome number evolution across all insects. Additionally, running a simpler model of chromosome number evolution without a coevolving binary trait shows us that insect orders vary dramatically in the overall rate of chromosome number evolution, a proxy of genome structural stability, and the pattern of evolution. These findings have important implications for our understanding of likely modes of speciation and offer insight into the most informative clades for future genome sequencing. <br><br>|
