### **Overview**
Welcome to the AGSx Virtual Symposium Spring 2024.  AGSx is organized and held independent of the annual Arthropod Genomics Symposium (AGS).  Goals of the AGSx symposia are to highlight recent advances in Arthropod genomics, on topics from genome assembly, editing and engineering, and focused areas of insects as food and honey bee research.  This is an opportunity for additional exchange of ideas and community interaction. 

AGSx 2024 is composed of four separate virtual webinars occuring between February and May. Symposia sessions are listed below, and more specific details on speakers will be updated as information becomes available.  Questions and open discussions will follow speaker presentations.

Sessions will be recorded. Once available you will be able to click "Video Recording" at the top of the speaker information table for a link to the session's recording, available through the [i5k Community YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/i5k_community). Subscribe to the channel to be notified when new videos are posted.

While some insects are farmed, others are harvested in the wild from forests or agricultural fields. As of right now, there are no established laboratory procedures to verify the identity of insect products sold as food or feed. The use of a Metagenomic Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) method to identify whole insects and products derived from insects that are marketed as food or food ingredients will be the main topic of this presentation. The safety concerns related to insects as food will also be briefly covered in this presentation. <br><br>|

When specific microorganisms are provided as a dietary supplement, insect reproduction, food conversion and growth are enhanced and health is improved in cases of nutritional deficiency or pathogen infection. Insect–microbiota interactions and the presence of beneficial microbes play an essential role in preserving insect health. Probiotic provision to insects reared for food and feed purposes could decrease the incidence of environmental and biological stress in mass-rearing conditions. A workflow for selecting bacterial strains for insect species reared for food and feed is proposed along with methods used to isolate and measure the effectiveness of a probiotic. A last discussion is focused on future perspectives on probiotic applications in mass-reared insects and the role of microbiota in preserving insect health. <br><br>|

Advances in breeding can accelerate the establishment of the quality traits that will drive the success of farmed insect populations, this includes the development of tools to measure and record relevant performance data. For example, biomarkers can be developed to measure the presence, progression or predisposition of particular conditions to gain valuable insights in the overall health of the insects reared for animal feed. This presentation will discuss potential biomarkers for studying various conditions important in the commercial farming of the black soldier fly (BSF) (*Hermetia illucens*). <br><br>|
