### **AGSx Virtual Symposium**
AGSx is a Virtual Symposium held in the Spring, typically between February and May with one session each month focused on a different theme. AGSx is organized and held independent of the annual Arthropod Genomics Symposium (AGS). Goals of the AGSx symposia are to highlight recent advances in Arthropod genomics, on topics from genome assembly, editing and engineering, and focused areas of insects as food and honey bee research. Sessions are recorded and available through the [i5k Community YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/i5k_community).
