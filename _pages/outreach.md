### **AGSx Virtual Symposium**
AGSx is a Virtual Symposium hosted annually by the i5k Community in the Spring, typically between February and May, with one session each month focused on a different theme. AGSx is organized and held independent of the annual Arthropod Genomics Symposium (AGS). Goals of the AGSx symposia are to highlight recent advances in Arthropod genomics, on topics from genome assembly, editing and engineering, and focused areas of insects as food and honey bee research. 

The program for each symposia, including talk abstracts, can be found on their websites linked below. Sessions are recorded and available through the [i5k Community YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/i5k_community).

### **2020 Arthropod Genomics Symposium**
The 13th Annual Arthropod Genomics Symposium, held July 21-23 2020, was a fully virtual meeting due to the COVID-19 pandemic. More information about the symposium, including the agenda, can be found on the [website](/ags2020) and recordings of the talks are available as a [Playlist on the i5k Community YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLLZE8MtMDu5PzRuTFqANWimBzTFhm9FO6).

### **i5k Webinar Series**
The i5k Webinar Series ran from October 2016 to December 2019.  Webinars introduced researchers to a variety of techniques, technologies and best practices to help move their research forward. More information about the series including information on all of the talks can be found on the [website](/webinar) and recordings of the talks are available as a [Playlist on the i5k Community YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLLZE8MtMDu5NtuelDXvPuwxxbJwRTEKQn).
