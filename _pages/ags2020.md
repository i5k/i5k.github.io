<a name="overview"></a> 
### **Overview**
The symposium focuses on new insights gleaned from analysing arthropod genomes and is designed for scientists interested in genomic studies of arthropods, including model organisms, those of importance to agriculture or health, and those of ecological or evolutionary interest. The programme will include presentations from speakers covering several major themes with opportunities for online discussions and interactions amongst all participants. AGS has a history of welcoming postdoctoral, graduate, and undergraduate students, who are again particularly encouraged to join.

### **Registration**
To attend the 2020 Arthropod Genomics Symposium, registration is required (free). Please use [**this form**](https://forms.gle/XgEHUvf41zgDaKCW8) to register for the meeting. Registrants will be sent an invitation to join the AGS Slack Workspace approximately two weeks before the meeting starts. The AGS Slack Workspace is restricted to registered participants and all organisational communications will be sent through the Workspace channels.  For more information on how to participate, please [read this guide](/ags/AGS2020-HowTo.pdf).

### **DRAFT Schedule**
For this year&#39;s Arthropod Genomics Symposium, speakers were selected from an open list of community suggestions. Webinars will span a 3-hour period split into two speaker sessions each day (08-11 PDT [US West Coast] ~ 11-14 EDT [US East Coast] ~ 17-20 CET [Europe]). The China session will precede the webinars on Wednesday (08-10 EDT [US East Coast] ~ 14-16 CET [Europe] ~ 20-22 CST [Beijing]). At the end of each day we plan to hold informal discussions. Although the exact format of the discussion is yet to be decided, we hope that speakers and attendees will join to continue and extend topic discussions in these interactive forums.

### **Technical**
A virtual meeting requires a few changes to normal conference organisation: participation will be managed through the AGS Slack Workspace and webinars will be broadcast on Zoom. User Guides describing different aspects of how the meeting will be run will be provided to all registered participants once they have joined the AGS Slack Workspace. Until then, simply make sure your Slack and Zoom installations are up-to-date, or sign up for and install them (see [**Slack**](https://slack.com/) and [**Zoom**](https://zoom.us/) websites for details).

<a name="v-posters"></a> 
### **V-Posters**
The online format of this meeting means that all participants may present a &#39;V-Poster&#39; describing their research project(s). There will be no formal selection process for V-Posters, and due to participants joining from different time zones there will be no dedicated V-Poster sessions. V-Posters act as a graphical advertisement for your project to encourage other attendees to meet with you (online) and discuss further.
