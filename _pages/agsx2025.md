### **Key Dates**
ü¶ó [Wednesday, April 8](#apr8) - Session 1: Insect Genome Biology and Evolution <br>
ü™∞ [Tuesday, May 13](#may13) - Session 2: Genomic Advances in Non-Model Arthropod Pests <br>

<a name="overview"></a> 
### **Overview**
Welcome to the AGSx Virtual Symposium Spring 2025.  AGSx is organized and held independent of the annual Arthropod Genomics Symposium (AGS).  Goals of the AGSx symposia are to highlight recent advances in Arthropod genomics, on topics from genome assembly, editing and engineering, and focused areas of insects as food and honey bee research.  This is an opportunity for additional exchange of ideas and community interaction. 

AGSx 2025 features two separate virtual webinars in April and May. Symposia sessions are listed below, and more specific details on speakers will be updated as information becomes available.  Questions and open discussions will follow speaker presentations.

Sessions will be recorded. Once available you will be able to click "Video Recording" at the top of the speaker information table for a link to the session's recording, available through the [i5k Community YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/i5k_community). Subscribe to the channel to be notified when new videos are posted.

These locust species show an extreme form of density-dependent phenotypic plasticity in which cryptic and shy individuals, known as the solitarious phase, can transform into conspicuous and gregarious individuals, known as the gregarious phase, in response to changes in local population density. In fact, this ‚Äúlocust phase polyphenism‚Äù is what makes the locusts distinctly different from regular grasshoppers. Intriguingly, *Schistocerca* includes 45 species, most of which are non-swarming sedentary grasshopper species, and phylogenetic studies have shown that the locust species do not form a monophyletic group, suggesting that locust phase polyphenism has evolved multiple times in the genus. Furthermore, recent experimental studies have indicated that some of the non-swarming grasshopper species show reduced density-dependent phenotypic plasticity, suggesting that *Schistocerca* as a whole is an exciting model clade that can be used to study how phenotypic plasticity has evolved as species diverge.<br><br>Until now, it has been very challenging to study these insects from a genomic perspective because of their large genome sizes (up to 9.1 Gb), which are the largest among insects. Recently, however, we launched the Behavioral Plasticity Research Institute (BPRI) supported by the National Science Foundation Biology Integration Institute (NSF-BII) program, which allowed us to produce high-quality chromosome-length assemblies of six *Schistocerca* species, including three locust and three non-swarming grasshopper species. These genomes were generated using PacBio HiFi and Hi-C technologies with a target coverage of 30x and 15x, respectively. Our assemblies are highly contiguous (contig N50 ranging from 27.4 to 74.2 Mb and scaffold N50 ranging from 791.2 to 854.0 Mb) and consistent with known estimates of chromosome count (11 autosomal pairs + sex chromosome) for these species. In this presentation, we introduce these new genomes as well as other omics approaches that we are currently pursuing, including transcriptomics, epigenomics, and single-cell genomics. We also introduce the overall vision and research activities of the BPRI, and make a strong case for why *Schistocerca* is an excellent model clade for biological integration.<br><br>Websites: schistocerca.org/SongLab; behavioralplasticity.org<br><br>|
